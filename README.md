# Educational Project: jQuery UI, Puzzle Game with Drag and Drop Functionality

## Repository Description
In this educational project, I focused on creating a puzzle game using jQuery UI and implementing various interactive features:

- **Draggable**: Used to enable the dragging of puzzle elements (image pieces) using the mouse.

- **Droppable**: Used to define the target area where draggable puzzle elements can be dropped. In our case, the right block serves as the target area for placing the puzzle pieces.

- **Sortable**: Used to provide the ability to sort the puzzle elements within the top block to change their order.

- **Parallax Effect**: Used to create a parallax effect, adding visual depth and movement to the puzzle image.

With these features and user interaction, the puzzle can be broken into individual pieces that can be dragged and then placed into the corresponding area. The time limit and control buttons add an additional element to the game, triggering appropriate messages and functionality blocking.
In this project, jQuery UI is used to create interactivity, specifically for drag and drop functionality and puzzle sorting. These capabilities allow players to interact with the game elements and solve the puzzle.

Happy coding!
